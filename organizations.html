                            "The Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) is firmly committed to fostering an inclusive 
                            environment that enables a diverse community to be involved in and contribute to AWM activities. 
                            The AWM believes that all people with an interest in mathematics should be supported and encouraged 
                            to participate in the profession. Any type of underrepresentation is a problem for the entire 
                            mathematical community: it inevitably leads to missed opportunities and the loss of mathematical 
                            talent. Thus, the AWM strongly endorses the National Science Foundation's goal of 
                            'broadening participation' in order to 'increase participation from underrepresented groups' 
                            in the mathematical sciences (See the NSF's Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in 
                            Science and Engineering for a description of these groups). It is AWM's goal to celebrate, 
                            recognize and support a diverse mathematical community of individuals from across the spectrum of age, 
                            race, gender, gender identity and expression, national or ethnic origin, religion and religious belief, 
                            marital status, parental status, body shape or size, sexual orientation, physical ability, socioeconomic 
                            status, employment status and other aspects of diversity."
